# This project reads egg temperature data from an external file and displays it in a simple user interface. The UI highlights the temperature with color coding for easy monitoring:

Red → if the temperature is above 80°C

Yellow → if the temperature is above 50°C but less than or equal to 80°C

Green → if the temperature is 50°C or below

The goal of the project is to provide a quick and visual way to track egg temperature status.
